# PHP-URL
## This package can manipulate URLs and capture a screenshot of a page.

It can perform several operations with URLs like:

- Cenerate the slug part from a text string
- Retrieve the contents of the respective page
- Extract the page title, meta description, keywords, images
- Capture a screenshot using the Google Page Speed API
- Check url is exists or not
- Use CURL so `allow_url_fopen = off ` is best for security `on` is not required
